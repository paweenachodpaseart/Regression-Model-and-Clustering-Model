# Regression-Model-and-Clustering-Model
Analyze the impact of tomato production on agricultural energy consumption

### 📌 Project Overview 
This project focuses on studying the relationship between tomato production volume and energy consumption in the agricultural sector across multiple countries. By utilizing Data Science, the analysis covers data from 1991 to 2021 to provide deep insights for energy management and enhance agricultural production efficiency, with the Regression model explaining approximately 72.15% of the data variance.

### 🎯 Objectives
1. Analyze the relationship between tomato production volume and energy consumption.
2. Build a Polynomial Regression Model to predict the correlation.
3. Develop K-Means Clustering to classify countries with similar trends in production and energy usage.
   
### 🛠️ Tool: R
